# Bus-Arrival-Prediction-using-ANN

# bus arrival prediction is a model that use Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to optimize bus transportation systems and improve passenger experiences. It outlines the process of collecting historical bus data, preprocessing and selecting relevant features, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and designing the architecture of the ANN model. The model incorporates real-time traffic data and features such as time of day, day of the week, and traffic congestion to improve prediction accuracy. 
# It also emphasizes the importance of feature selection, model robustness, and accuracy evaluation using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE. The analysis includes sensitivity analysis, feature importance analysis, visualization of predicted vs. actual arrival times, and error analysis to uncover potential areas for model improvement. The conclusion highlights the potential of the model to accurately predict bus arrival times based on various factors and its application in a larger transportation management system.
